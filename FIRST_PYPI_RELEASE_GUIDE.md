## ✅ Tag Created and Pushed!

The release tag `v0.1.0` has been created and pushed to GitHub. This will trigger the publish workflow.

---

## 📋 What Happens Next

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Triggered**

The publish workflow is now running at:
👉 https://github.com/ross-sec/fractal-attention-analysis/actions

**Workflow Steps:**
1. ✅ **Build** - Creates wheel and source distribution
2. ✅ **Publish to TestPyPI** - Automatic (for testing)
3. ⏸️ **Publish to PyPI** - **WAITS FOR YOUR APPROVAL**

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Complete Setup BEFORE Workflow Runs

### Step 1: Configure Trusted Publishing on PyPI

**You MUST do this before the workflow completes, or it will fail!**

#### For PyPI (Production):
1. Go to: https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
2. Click **"Add a new pending publisher"**
3. Fill in **EXACTLY**:
   ```
   PyPI Project Name: fractal-attention-analysis
   Owner: ross-sec
   Repository name: fractal_attention_analysis
   Workflow name: publish.yml
   Environment name: pypi
   ```
4. Click **"Add"**

#### For TestPyPI (Testing - Recommended):
1. Go to: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/
2. Same details as above, but:
   ```
   Environment name: testpypi
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Environments

1. Go to: https://github.com/ross-sec/fractal-attention-analysis/settings/environments
2. Click **"New environment"**
3. Name: `pypi`
4. Click **"Configure environment"**
5. Check ✅ **"Required reviewers"**
6. Add yourself (ross-sec) as a reviewer
7. Click **"Save protection rules"**

8. Repeat for `testpypi` environment (no reviewers needed)

## 🎯 Approving the PyPI Release

Once the workflow reaches the PyPI publishing step:

1. Go to: https://github.com/ross-sec/fractal-attention-analysis/actions
2. Click on the **"Publish Python 🐍 distribution 📦 to PyPI and TestPyPI"** workflow
3. You'll see a yellow banner: **"Review pending deployments"**
4. Click **"Review deployments"**
5. Check the box for **"pypi"**
6. Click **"Approve and deploy"**

**The package will then be published to PyPI!**

## 🔍 Verifying the Publication

### Check TestPyPI (Published Automatically):
👉 https://test.pypi.org/project/fractal-attention-analysis/

### Check PyPI (After Approval):
👉 https://pypi.org/project/fractal-attention-analysis/

### Test Installation:
```bash
# From TestPyPI (for testing)
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ fractal-attention-analysis

# From PyPI (production)
pip install fractal-attention-analysis
```

### Verify It Works:
```python
from fractal_attention_analysis import FractalAttentionAnalyzer

analyzer = FractalAttentionAnalyzer("gpt2")
results = analyzer.analyze("Hello world!")
print(f"Fractal Dimension: {results['fractal_dimension']:.4f}")
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Trusted publisher not configured"

**Solution:** Complete Step 1 above. The PyPI Trusted Publishing must be set up BEFORE the workflow tries to publish.

### Error: "Environment protection rules not satisfied"

**Solution:** Complete Step 2 above. The GitHub environment must exist with you as a required reviewer.

### Error: "Project name already exists"

**Solution:** This means someone else has already claimed the name `fractal-attention-analysis` on PyPI. You would need to:
1. Choose a different name in `pyproject.toml`
2. Update the name in PyPI Trusted Publishing configuration
3. Create a new tag

### Workflow is Waiting for Approval

**This is NORMAL!** Go to the Actions page and approve the deployment as described above.
